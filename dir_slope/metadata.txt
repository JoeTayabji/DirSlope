description=This plugin calculates directional slope along a line. A DEM is required.

about=This plugin is designed to calculate the directional slope of a line. It takes two inputs: a line and a DEM raster, both of which must be projected. The output is a new line. The user can specify a sampling distance. The input line will be split at this distance into new segments. The directional slope is calculated at the midpoint of the new segment. This plugin uses Horn's method for calculating slope at any location (Horn, 1981). It then uses a trigonemtric calculation to adjust for directionality (Neteler and Mitášová, 2008). For a given cell at location e, a 3x3 kernel can be designated as: a b c d e f g h i From this, we can say the slope at e is: slope_radians = arctan ( sqrt ( [dz/dx]^2 + [dz/dy]^2) ) where: [dz/dx] = ( (c + 2f + i) - (a + 2d + g) ) / (8 * cellsize) [dz/dy] = ( (g + 2h + i) - (a + 2b + c) ) / (8 * cellsize) given: the cellsize is the spatial resolution of the DEM With this, we can say that the slope at location e with a bearing alpha is: directional slope (alpha) = arctan [ (dz/dx) * sin(alpha) + (dz/dy) * cos(alpha) ]
